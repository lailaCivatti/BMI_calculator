# BMI_calculator is my first application of HTML5, CSS3 (with SCSS) and vanilla JS (haven't learned React yet).
It is supposed to be a simple interface were user enters weight and height and gets a Body Mass Index result shown on screen.
Still need to work on form validation and adding more functionalities to the app, though.
That's it for now =)
