# BMI_calculator is my first application of HTML5, CSS3 (with SCSS) and vanilla JS (haven't learned React yet).
It is supposed to be a simple interface where user enters weight and height and gets a Body Mass Index result shown on screen.
Still need to work on form validation and adding more functionalities to the app, though.

Things to do:
1. Make design responsive;
2. Make sure accessibility is okay;
3. Apply limits to values users can enter;
4. Place event for validating input on real time as user types;
5. Check if SCSS is well structured (apply BEM);

That's it for now =)
